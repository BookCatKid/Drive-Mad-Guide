# Drive Mad Guide

Welcome to my **Drive Mad Guide**! I love **Drive Mad** but had some trouble on a few levels, especially the new 100 levels on poki, and I realised there were barely any tutorials, so I made this guide to help anyone who needs it!

I also plan to have Gold Score help, because they can be very difficult and confusing (in fact, even I dont know how to get them all!)

## Project Description

This **Drive Mad Guide** has:

- Instructions on how to complete each level
- YouTube video walkthroughs (when available)
- Tags related to every level (e.g., difficulty, strategies)
- Gold score suggestions to help you achieve the best possible performance (planned)

## How to Access

You can access the **Drive Mad Guide** directly on GitHub Pages at the following URL:

[https://bookcatkid.github.io/Drive-Mad-Guide/](https://bookcatkid.github.io/Drive-Mad-Guide/)

Simply navigate to the corresponding level by clicking on the level on the homepage.

The url format is `/guides.html?level=<level-number>` . For example:

- **Level 1**: `https://bookcatkid.github.io/Drive-Mad-Guide/guides.html?level=1`
- **Level 2**: `https://bookcatkid.github.io/Drive-Mad-Guide/guides.html?level=2`
