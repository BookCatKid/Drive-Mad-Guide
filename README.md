# Drive Mad Guide

Welcome to the **Drive Mad Guide**! This project provides a detailed guide to help you beat every level in the game **Drive Mad**. Each level is accompanied by helpful instructions, a YouTube video walkthrough (if available), and possibly a gold score to aim for. Feel free to explore the content and let me know if you encounter any issues.
I love this game and had some trouble on a few levels, especially the new 100 levels on poki, so I made this guide to help anyone who needs it!
I also plan to have Gold Score help, because they can be very difficult and confusing (in fact, even I dont know how to get them all!)

## Project Description

This **Drive Mad Guide** has:

- Instructions on how to complete each level
- YouTube video walkthroughs (when available)
- Tags related to every level (e.g., difficulty, strategies)
- Gold score suggestions to help you achieve the best possible performance (planned)
